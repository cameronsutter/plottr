### 1. My Windows Computer says it won't open Plottr  

Look for a link that says "More info". When you click that, it will show a button that says "Run anyway".   
Plottr is not currently code-signed because that costs hundreds of dollars. In the future, I plan to code-sign it.

### 2. My Mac says it can't open Plottr  

Either change your preferences in System Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Allow apps  
Or run the following command in the terminal to allow Plottr

### 3. Why can't I save my file?

### 4. Can I write my story with Plottr?

### 5. How is this better than Scrivener?  

Plottr doesn't try to do what Scrivener does. It doesn't let you write your story, it's all about planning and plotting out your story.  
Scrivener never felt like it was good at timelines, storylines, or multiple plot lines. Plottr is the best at those things.

### 6. What devices does Plottr work on?

Plottr currently works on Mac & Windows desktops and laptops. It also can work on Windows tablets.  
It does not work on mobile phones or tablets (Android or iOS). Not yet at least ...
