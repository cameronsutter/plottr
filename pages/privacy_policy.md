The only thing we collect is anonymous usage data from the desktop and mobile apps of Plottr. Those apps transmit your IP address and computer/phone name along with usage data.

I use it to **1)** look at a few dashboards of how much Plottr is being used so I can feel good about making something that people like and use and **2)** track errors that you run into so I can fix Plottr bugs
